# CBL-couse-evaluation

This is a side project collaborating with previous student advisor in Dalian Medical University. The instructor designed a new biochemistry laboratory course that enables students to be involved in a case-based study. She was hoping that I could help her to evaluate the course effects.

Because I am familiar with both R and SAS, I tried to utilize the advatanges of both programming lanuages. To be specific, the data wrangling was done in R, and analysis was done in SAS.
